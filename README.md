[Brief Introduction]

As a seasoned Network Administrator with over a decade of experience, I am passionate about fortifying network security and optimizing IT infrastructure to ensure seamless business operations. With a BS in Information Systems and Cybersecurity from ITT Technical Institute and a diverse array of certifications, including CompTIA Security+, I am dedicated to staying at the forefront of the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape. Throughout my career at Sutherland Products Inc., I have demonstrated my expertise in proactive network risk mitigation, threat detection, and network optimization. I have successfully developed and implemented comprehensive network testing plans, designed robust backup and recovery procedures, and conducted in-depth risk assessments and vulnerability analyses. My hands-on experience with firewall configuration, cloud computing, and data security has equipped me with the skills necessary to safeguard business continuity and minimize security risks. I am particularly proud of my ability to diagnose and resolve complex network connectivity issues swiftly, ensuring minimal downtime and smooth business operations. My role as a Subject Matter Expert on network device operating systems has enabled me to troubleshoot and address intricate network challenges effectively. In addition to my professional accomplishments, I am continuously expanding my knowledge and skill set. I am currently pursuing the CompTIA CYSA+ certification, which will further enhance my capabilities as a cybersecurity professional. My recent involvement in the Mastercard Cybersecurity virtual experience program and the Telstra SOC simulation has provided me with valuable insights into identifying and mitigating security threats, analyzing malware propagation, and implementing effective security measures. With a strong foundation in technical security awareness, strategy, and problem-solving, I am committed to making a positive impact in the field of cybersecurity. I am always eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities to leverage my expertise in enhancing organizational security and resilience.
